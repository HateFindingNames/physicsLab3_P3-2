In summary, one can say that the experiment was successful. The boost converter shows similar values for lower voltages
as the simulation had calculated. The measured value for the repetition frequency deviates from the calculated value by
quite a bit. In general, all graphs recorded at the oscilloscope corresponded to the expected curve. The propagation
times in the cable could be determined well. The cable characteristics are close to the values given in the data sheet.
The Time Domain Reflectometry experiment clearly demonstrated how cable damage can be detected and repaired. The evaluation
of the test result is difficult, since the actual length of the cable and the position of the fault are not given as a
reference in the experiment instructions.
